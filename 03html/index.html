        <h4><u>Getting started with C programming</u></h4>
        <p> C is one of its own type of programming language that shares some of its syntax to almost all programming language on the planet. C gives the basic idea about data types, variable, constants, loops, function and other concepts that will always be there in all programming language.  Since C does not come with lots of built in functionality, we will look into how to create those functionality. This Course is designed for both MAC and WINDOWS users and there is specific video dealing with setting up environment on both platforms. Just within few videos you will learn to setup environment to code on C. After that we will slowly move on understanding programming that will clear up about advantage of writing codes. After taking this course you can move to any programming language and within few hours of looking at syntax, you will be able to design your own logics to solve the complex problems. Just practice with us in building command line applications along with this course. </p>

        <h4><u>Python3, from scratch to pro</u> </h4>
        <p>Python is a topmost language in the scripting world. Python is fully capable of handling automation tasks as well as to further levels such as Django or even penetration testing. All starts with the basic of python. We will target 3.X version of python, which is an entirely new branch of python. Most people are moving towards this branch as it is purely object oriented and have been designed from scratch. According to an official statement, python3 will only be supported in the future and the official site will soon discontinue the support for 2.X branch. Everyone is switching to this new python and it's the right time for you to get started. This course is not a course full of jargons, as we understand that powerpoint and too much high-end programming jargon words can make you sleep easily. Course is a full hands on practice with a small touch of fun. </p>
